            We are open to the generation of collaborative content, either at
            our four locations or anywhere in the world. Our purpose is not to
            identify ourselves as a company, but as a group willing to create
            content that generates change and/or solves problems.<br /><br />The
            collaborative work we do with different production companies,
            artists and/or directors allows us to share and create better
            results. We feel ready to attend to any proposal and work it in the
            best way as we have been doing during these years.
